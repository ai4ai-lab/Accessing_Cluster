# Accessing_Cluster
Repo explaining how to access imperial cluster for computing resources simplified

In order to connect to the HPC cluster remotely you must first connect to the imperial VPN described here https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/connect-communicate/remote-access/virtual-private-network-vpn/. Next you will need to use an SSH client to connect to the HPC server. From Linux or Mac simply open a terminal and run 'ssh username@login.hpc.imperial.ac.uk'. From windows you will need to use a client such as Putty, openSSH or MobaXterm, this guide shows the process for using MobaXterm. 

Download Mobaxterm from https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ and open a session. Select session followed by ssh and enter yourusername@login.hpc.imperial.ac.uk in remote host. ![image](https://github.com/ai4ai-lab/Accessing_Cluster/assets/60004524/8fb352e8-3d49-4374-8189-0f557dcbafd1)
